# REGARDS cloud

REGARDS is still under development. **This version is a beta version**.

This is the microservice infrastructure repository. It manages :
* System gateway (relying on Netflix Zuul),
* System authentication (relying on Spring OAuth2),
* Microservice registry for load balancing (relying on Netflix Eureka),
* Configuration (relying on Spring Cloud Config).

## Build
The [README](https://github.com/RegardsOss/regards-deployment/blob/master/README.md) of the project [rs-deployment](https://github.com/RegardsOss/regards-deployment) describes how to generate all the REGARDS repositories.
