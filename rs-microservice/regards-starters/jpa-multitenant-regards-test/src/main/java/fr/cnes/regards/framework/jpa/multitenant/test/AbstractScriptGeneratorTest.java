/**
 * Generate the diff between already existing SQL migration scripts and content of your model.<br/>
 * Extends this test class in dao layer and ensure the <b>public schema is empty</b> on the target database.
 * Then you can safely run the test : <br/>
 * 1] To do that, annotate your class with following code.
 * <code>
 * @TestPropertySource(properties = {"regards.jpa.multitenant.migrationTool=FLYWAYDB"})
 * </code>
 * Then execute your test. It should execute FLYWAY migration (all SQL files in your module) against the public schema.
 * 2] Comment the annotation you added above your class and execute another time the migration (this time using HBM2DDL).
 * You can now find in the target folder the SQL diff that you can use to complete your FLYWAY migration.
