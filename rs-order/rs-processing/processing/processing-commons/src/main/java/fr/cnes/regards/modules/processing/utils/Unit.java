/**
 * A class with no information, with only a single instance ({@link Unit#UNIT}).

 * Whereas {@link Void} is supposed to have no instance, and thus no returned value
 * (even though null is required to be used as a substitute), Unit is supposed to have
 * a single non-null value with no information: it returns something, a "proof" that the computation
 * occurred normally.
 * <br/>
 * It is still possible to use null as a secondary instance of Unit, but it must never be done.
